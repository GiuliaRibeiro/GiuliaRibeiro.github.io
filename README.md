### Transition to Data Analysis
While my background is rooted in bioinformatics and molecular biology, I am actively transitioning into a career in **data analysis**. My goal is to leverage my expertise in big data processing, programming, and statistical modeling to address challenges in diverse industries beyond academia.

### Academic Background
- **PhD in Sciences** and **Master‚Äôs in Sciences** from the University of S√£o Paulo.
- International research experience at **Smith College (USA)** and **Real Jard√≠n Bot√°nico de Madrid (Spain)**.
- Ongoing studies in **Data Science** to enhance expertise in programming, machine learning, and statistical analysis.

## Expertise
- **High-throughput sequencing**: Genomics, transcriptomics, barcoding.
- **Data analysis**: Gene expression, phylogenomics, methylation analysis.
- **Programming & Computing**: Bash, Python, R, SLURM, HPC systems (e.g., UPPMAX).
- **Project Management**: Utilizing Nextflow for bioinformatics pipelines.
- **Molecular Biology Techniques**: DNA/RNA extraction, library preparation, genome assembly, phylogenetic analysis.

## Portfolio Highlights
### Bioinformatics Projects
- **Genomics & Epigenetics**: Pipelines for methylation and genome assembly analysis.
- **Environmental DNA Sequencing**: Microbial diversity exploration with Illumina and Nanopore data.
- **Phylogenomic Tools**: Workflows for phylogenetic and transcriptomic data.

### Contributions
- Development of **custom bioinformatics pipelines**.
- **Data visualization** for genomics insights.
- Research on **machine learning applications** in biological data.
